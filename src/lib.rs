//! # boolean\_expression expression manipulation / BDD library
//!
//! This crate provides for the manipulation and evaluation of Boolean expressions
//! and Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs), and the construction of BDDs from Boolean
//! expressions. It can also simplify Boolean expressions via either a set of rules
//! such as DeMorgan's Law (see `Expr::simplify_via_laws()`), or via a
//! roundtrip through a `BDD` and a cubelist-based term reduction (see
//! `Expr::simplify_via_bdd()`). The latter is more powerful, but also more
//! expensive.
//!
//! The main pieces of interest are:
//!
//! * `Expr`, an AST enum for expression simple `AND` / `OR` / `NOT`-based expressions.
//! * `BDD`, a Binary Decision Diagram implementation.
//! * `CubeList`, a low-level datatype with support for cubelist manipulation
//!   (used when converting `BDD` functions to expressions).
